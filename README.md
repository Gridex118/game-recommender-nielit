# Game Recommender System as a Classification Problem

This is a Data Science project made for the NIELIT 2025 summer training.

> [!NOTE]
> The project was made using `emacs`(org), and is the preferred viewing method. A `.ipynb` file has, however, been generated using `pandoc`, with a few manual edits, and *should* work fine in `jupyter notebook|lab` or any compatible software.

All datasets were obtained from **Kaggle**, a link to which has been included in the `.org` and `.ipynb` files. This repository only contains the files after a bit of preprocessing, and the original files are required to be downloaded from **Kaggle** if a full reproduction of the notebook is desired.

A `environment.yaml` file for the `conda` environment used in the project has also been included in this repository. This can be reproduced using `conda create --file ./environment.yaml`
